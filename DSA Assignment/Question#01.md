### Q1) Difference between Big-O and Big-Theta?

- **Big-O (O)**:
  - Big-O notation represents the upper bound of the running time of an algorithm.
  - It provides a worst-case scenario for the time complexity.
  - Example: If an algorithm runs in O(n<sup>2</sup>), it means that in the worst case, the running time will not exceed c (n<sup>2</sup>) for some constant `c`.
  
- **Big-Theta (Θ)**:
  - Big-Theta notation represents the tight bound of the running time of an algorithm.
  - It gives both the upper and lower bounds, meaning the algorithm runs in this time complexity in the average case.
  - Example: If an algorithm runs in Θ(n<sup>2</sup>), it means that the running time will always be proportional to n<sup>2</sup>, both in the average and worst cases.
